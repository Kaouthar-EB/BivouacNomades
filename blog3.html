        <h2>Foum Zguid desert camp: foum zguid to erg chegaga tours</h2><br>
    <p>
        Foum Zguid is the door city to the Sahara of Chegaga and Lake Iriki. From Marrakech it takes about 6 hour normal drive to reach Foum Zguid through the high Atlas Mountains. From Agadir it takes around 5 hours drive to get there. It is the perfect place to make some shopping for the Chech (turban) or simple gifts from the Sahara. <br>

        From Foum Zguid it will take you about 1/30 mns till 2 hours drive to reach our lake Iriki desert camp in the middle of dunes of Erg Elmhazil. The Sahara of lake Iriki is one of the unique desert where you will discover the real Sahara far away from common touristic places. It is very calm place where you will find only two desert camps in the middle of nowhere. If you want to organize your desert tour only from Foum Zguid, you need to choose a local agency or guide to benefit from your desert tour.<br>
        
        If you choose our local small company, we will take you to places nobody else go, make sure that you are in safe hands and make sure that you will benefit from your desert tour because you will learn a lot and you will have a great Sahara experience from Foum Zguid.<br>
        
        
        
        What can you see in Lake Iriki Sahara?<br>
        
         In the Sahara of lake Iriki, you will discover the interesting old small village of Sidi Abd Anabi, and the old Ksar, which is the original living village of Elmhazil early tribe, the remaining construction is a sign of thousands of interesting stories in the old past. There is also the Marabou of the grand Holly father of the whole tribe of Elmhazil. This person who was a very important ritual person in the whole tribe at that time. People even now, still visit his grave to take the Baraka, to be healed from different illnesses and to solve different problems. For example, if a woman is seeking for marriage, but can’t find a husband or if she is married but, can’t be a pregnant, she visits his grave believing that he will help her. There are a lot of interesting old stories that people still believe in you might discover in visiting this nomadic small village. Superstition is part of the culture and beliefs here. The locals of Zaouit Sidi Abd Anabi survive as nomads although they do not move because they construct small houses out from the clay but they still survive on goats and dromedaries. They also have a little bit of agriculture. They grow some vegetables to support the family. You can also visit the nomadic school just few kilometers from the village of Zaouit Sidi Abd Anabi. This School was set up few years ago by a Spanish non-governmental association to help local nomad’s children to study to know how to read, how to calculate, and a little bit of French also.<br>
        
        Lake Iriki was considered one of the main biggest lakes in Africa. It was a house for many kinds of animals, such as gazelles, fennecs, a lot of kinds of birds as well as many kinds of fish. Life for nomads at that time was much easier because they find water for their animals in the lake and they survive on fishing and hunting in the lake too.
        
         My grandmother told me that Lake Iriki was called the stomach of the valley of Daraa that stretches from Ouarzazate and Zagora to Tagnit. Then, from there to lake Iriki to the sea of Tantan, but because of the strategy of Hassan 2, they constructed the dam in Ouarzazate . Consequently, no more water go through the valley of Ouad Daraa. Finally, the Lake was gradually drying until there is no drop of water in the deep surface. When the lake has just got dry, you can't pass nearby because of the bad smells of the dead animals and fish. Birds immigrated to other places and the ones cannot go far they sadly died one after the other.<br>

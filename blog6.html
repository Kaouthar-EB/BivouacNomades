        <h2> How to choose your best Moroccan desert tour?
        </h2><br>
    <p>
        There are thousands of agencies and hotels, which offer desert tours and excursion to the Sahara, but as a tourist who might like to visit the kingdom for the first time, you need to know what is the best agency or hotel for you so that you can enjoy the best desert experience ever. <br>



The Sahara is a unique interesting place, but if you do not meet a local desert person who lives in the Sahara and know everything about it as the back of his hand, who will explain to you the history of the Sahara. The imagery stories of his old parent in the Sahara, how nomads were trading in the Sahara and how the caravans of nomads were crossing to border to reach Mali, Tchad, Borkinafassou, Nijer to exchange products, how was Twarig crossing the Moroccan borders to reach the Moroccan Sahara to exchange product? How people survive in the Sahara not the people who might have got used to tourism, but real nomads who are living in the remote desert after crossing many kilometers away from the last city. <br> <br>



You should choose someone who will tell you and teach about dromedaries and how to deal with them because we cannot talk about nomads without mentioning the dromedaries. Wherever there is Sahara, there are nomads, dromedaries and goats. <br>

 

To learn to survive in the Sahara by yourself, you need to find out how old nomads and our grandparent used to travel by the guidance of stars. In addition, you need to learn how to prepare bread and how to cook local food in the Sahara in open air without Gaz and with primitive cooking tools. There are many people may drive you to Sahara, but they cannot explain you the history of the Sahara exactly as it was unless he or she is a real local nomad. He/ she will not know where the best beautiful places are in the Sahara, only the touristic ones. <br>

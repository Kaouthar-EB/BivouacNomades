        <h2>Where is the Moroccan national park of lake Iriki located?</h2><br>
    <p>
        Iriki National Park which lays between the Draa River and the foothills of the south Anti-Atlas near the Algerian border. 150 km south of Ouazazate and 80 km southwest of Zagora. <br> <br>    </p>
        
        <h2>What make lake Iriki so interesting?</h2><br>
<p>
    This lake is nowadays mostly dry. It was the favorite place of southern gazelles. The park consists of desert landscapes. The vegetation is characterized by a wooded steppe and acacia savanna. In wet periods (October, November, December). Lake Iriki is a stopover and wintering place for many migratory birds such as flamingos and geese. <br> <br>

    The lake Iriki was the crossing place for the caravan that was passing to Mali and Algeria and to the rest of Africa. We still have a place that is called souikka, which means the small market here in the desert of lake Iriki. in this place the caravans were exchanging products, such us milk Henna, camels... . <br> <br>    <h1 class="also">

    <h2>The different shapes of lake Iriki</h2><br>
    <p>
        Lake Iriki consists of may different landscape, such us the dunes, the Jebel Bani mountains in the north, flat and rocky and hammadas. The desert of lake Iriki is rich of fossils and stone paintings, that reflect the history and life of the nomads who were living in the desert of lake Iriki in the past. This is what makes it one of the most interesting worth discovering areas in Morocco, if you wont to discover the desert. You need to discover it with the camels and with locals for several days, or for sure a few days with the 4x4 also can give you an impression of the desert, but still not enough to discover it completely. <br> <br>    </p>

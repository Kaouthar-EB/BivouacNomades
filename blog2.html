        <h2>life of Nomades of Lake Iriki and chegaga desert</h2><br>
    <p>
        Erg Chegaga and Lake Iriki are two distinct areas within the Sahara Desert in Morocco, between Foum Zguid and Mhamid Elghizlane and they are inhabited by nomadic communities who have developed unique ways of life to survive in these harsh environments. Here's an overview of the life of nomads in Erg Chegaga and Lake Iriki and how they manage to survive:<br><br>

<h4>Erg Chegaga:</h4><br>

Nomadic Tribes:<br>

Erg Chegaga, located in the southwestern part of Morocco, is home to several nomadic tribes, including the Berber and Arab communities. These tribes have adapted their lifestyles to the desert's conditions.
Livelihood:<br>
Nomads in Erg Chegaga primarily rely on animal husbandry, especially camels, goats, and sheep. These animals provide them with milk, meat, wool, and transportation in the desert.
Tent Dwellings:<br>
Nomads in Erg Chegaga live in traditional camel-hair tents called "khaimas" or "berber tents." These tents are portable and can be easily erected and dismantled, allowing them to move with their herds.
Water Sources:<br>
Access to water is a major challenge in Erg Chegaga. Nomads often rely on oases, wells, and occasionally rainfall to provide water for themselves and their animals.
Food and Diet:<br>
The nomadic diet consists of dairy products, meat, and grains. They prepare simple yet nourishing dishes, such as tagine and couscous, khobzat lmala, or what we call the sand bread using the resources available.
Clothing and Protection:<br>
Nomads wear traditional clothing, which includes flowing robes and turbans to protect themselves from the sun and sandstorms. They also use camel hair blankets and rugs for warmth.
Lake Iriki: <br>

Semi-Nomadic Lifestyle:<br>
Lake Iriki is located in the Draa Valley region of Morocco. The people living around the lake often follow a semi-nomadic lifestyle, moving between the lake area and surrounding oases.
Agriculture and Pastoralism:<br>
Unlike the strictly nomadic communities in Erg Chegaga, some around Lake Iriki engage in small-scale agriculture in the oases. They cultivate date palms, vegetables, and other crops and supplement their diet with fish from the lake in the past when there was the lake before it dried out.
Water Management:<br>
Access to water is still a critical issue for those around Lake Iriki. Locals use ancient irrigation systems to harness water from underground wells and direct it to their fields.
Barter and Trade:<br>
People around Lake Iriki used to engage in trade and barter, exchanging goods like dates, salt, and handicrafts with neighboring communities and merchants who pass through the area. The caravane that was coming from mali, bourkinafasou, and niger ......
Social Structure:<br>
Both communities in Erg Chegaga and Lake Iriki have close-knit social structures. Extended families and tribal ties play an essential role in providing support and cooperation.
Survival in these desert environments relies on a combination of traditional knowledge, resourcefulness, and adaptation. While nomads in Erg Chegaga and those around Lake Iriki face significant challenges related to water scarcity and extreme temperatures, their deep connection to the land and their resilient way of life continue to sustain them in these remote and beautiful desert regions.

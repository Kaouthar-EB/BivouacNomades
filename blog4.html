If you are coming from tafraout or Tata it is the perfect place for you to make a Sahara tour firstly because it is before zagora you will need only 2 hours to reach the Sahara of lake iriki and 2:30 to reach chegaga desert.

If you come from Marrakech also it will be the close than Zagora or Merzouga and also it is the Sahara where you can have the full Authentic Sahara experience.   <br> <br>
If you are short in time you can have one night in the desert, you will enjoy your camel ride to see the sun set from the top of the big dunes of Erg chegaga or lake iriki. This is a very beautiful feeling that you can find only in the Sahara. You will enjoy your stay in a desert camp in the middle of the dunes and the beautiful sky full of thousands stars and the beautiful milkyway. <br><br>
Here you can choose if you want traditional standard camp or if you would like to be in a luxury desert camp. And the next morning you will take the 4×4 to return back to foum zguid in the way there also few things you can discover and experience. You can visit the nomadic school of lake iriki and see the history behind the non governmental association that help the nomade to learn how to write and read and also a little bit of calculation or you can enjoy a cup of tea with the local nomads of the area and see how they survive in the Sahara.

        <h2>Cooperative Ben Mahmoud - a cooperative by the nomads of the desert of lake Iriki</h2><br>
    <p>
        The cooperative was created in 2018, in the desert of Lake Iriki by Mustapha Elayadi and few family nomads’ women from Lake Iriki desert. <br>

Why did we create the cooperative?<br>

Since I was at the university, Ibn Zohr, in Agadir I was all the time regarding myself as a messenger of Nomads of my regional Sahara. Not so many nomads are lucky enough to finish their studies or go to school though due to many reasons; such poverty, ignorance about the importance of education, deficit of providing school needs. In addition to the high demand of kids to help their parents to make a living, shepherding goats and camels. Ultimately, traditional beliefs and the local culture impact is also another factor which prevent nomad’s kids from schooling.<br>
 That’s why I conducted my final research study at the university about: “the culture of nomads in Morocco, Sahara”. The aim was to make a little publicity to this minority before this culture and traditions disappear. <br>

When I got my degree in English studies, I was always trying to develop the area of Lake Iriki. Since my father have some camels, I started working with some agencies here in the desert so as to get a little income. Later on, I found this cooperative with other few nomads’ women in order to make some money and promote tourism in the area, hoping for some work opportunities to help families in Sahara.<br>

After we had founded the cooperative: “Ben Mahmoud”, we benefited a direct support from the states, a project fund from the provincial local state, Tata. So, we made 90% from 230000 as part of our cooperative.<br>



Our new project the cooperative of Ben Mahmoud<br>

There are so many women and families who have no income in the Sahara. Their life is turning hard and miserable. The harsh living conditions in Sahara push many od them to quit and took refuge to the cities. We are so sad because we are losing the culture and traditions of nomads. We are afraid! There is high chance that there will be no nomads. That’s why we have this new project to encourage women of nomads and their families to produce nomadic carpets, traditional tents which are basically made out of the wall of goats and camels. We really hope to support them secure a little money to make the living here. In this way, we are protecting the people and preserving the culture.<br>

Because Nomad women can’t sell the carpets and they need a budget to start this project, our cooperative took the financial charge and it will sell their works as well.<br>

The next part of our project is educating the next generation on how to make carpets and tents from the walls of sheep and goats.<br>



So as to prepare them for the future and help them to be self-workers. <br>

 The nomadic carpets: <br>

This carpet is made out of the wall of sheep. <br>

How will we collect the budget for the nomadic women to help them start?<br>

The cooperative has already produced some carpets so we will sell them and buy the necessary facilities for they will require. <br>

If you are an association, cooperative, organization or individual who can collaborate with us bring this new nomadic project to existence, we will be so glad to connect with you.<br>
